#  To-Do List Web Application

## Project Overview
Welcome to our simple To-Do List web application built as a **hackathon group project**. The application allows users to add, view, mark as complete, and delete tasks with a modern interface.

The project demonstrates collaborative web development with team members focusing on different aspects of the stack (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), while working together to create a polished final product.

## Features
-  Add new tasks dynamically
-  Mark tasks as completed (click on task)
-  Delete individual tasks
-  Pre-loaded example tasks
-  Modern gradient UI with smooth animations
-  Input validation (prevents empty tasks)
-  Keyboard support (Enter key to add tasks)

---

##  Technologies Used
- **HTML5** - Semantic page structure
- **CSS3** - Modern styling with gradients, flexbox, and animations
- **JavaScript (ES6)** - Dynamic DOM manipulation and event handling
