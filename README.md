# To-Do App (HTML Structure)

## Project Overview
This project is a simple To-Do application built as a group assignment.  
The goal of the app is to allow users to add, view, and manage daily tasks.

This repository contains the initial **HTML structure** of the application, which serves as the foundation for styling (CSS) and functionality (JavaScript).

## My Contribution
I was responsible for creating the **basic HTML layout** of the application.

This includes:
- Page title and main heading
- Input field for entering new tasks
- “Add Task” button
- Task list container using an unordered list
- Placeholder tasks for testing
- Use of semantic HTML elements (`header`, `main`, `section`)
- Clean structure and class names to support future CSS and JavaScript integration

## Technologies Used
- HTML5

---

## File Structure


---

## Notes
At this stage, the “Add Task” button is not functional, as interactivity will be handled using JavaScript in later development stages.  
Styling will also be added separately using CSS.
